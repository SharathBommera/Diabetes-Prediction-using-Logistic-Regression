# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Logistic-Regression
Diabetes is a chronic disease affecting millions globally, characterized by high blood sugar levels. Early detection is crucial to managing the disease and avoiding complications. This project leverages logistic regression and a web-based application to predict diabetes based on patient data. The system combines clinical parameters with machine learning to provide accurate results through a simple and intuitive interface.We have used Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset or similar datasets cleaned and formatted with required features like age, urea, HbA1c, cholesterol, and more.
